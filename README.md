# Unity-like app switcher (Gnome extension)

![alt](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension-data/screenshots/screenshot_3231.jpg)

Also adds the Alt+Tab special case removed [here](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-shell/commit/092e1a691d57a3be205100f7d3910534d3c59f84) (the first tab changes windows, the others app), and raises only one window when the app is selected (instead of all the windows).

BUGS:
 - The arrows don't follow the apps. It's a gnome bug, but still. For now, the text of the apps with multiple windows is underlined.
